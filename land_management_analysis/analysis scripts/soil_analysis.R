#### Creating the Function Comparing Average Soil Values from Inside Populations to Outside Populations ####

# This function iterates over each soil metric and compares the average soil metric across the known populations
# to a distribution of randomly generated distribution populations means to see if the known populations have significantly
# different soil metrics compared at random. 

# The components of the function are
# 1) generating an empty list for the soil means and the p-values from comparing the real and randomized population soil means.
# 2) a loop to iterate over each soil metric in which 
# generate a list of random soil means from randomly distributed populations (n=20, 1000 permutations),
# plots of the cropped Baja California Sur polygon and the randomly selected points,
# store the soil mean for the known population,
# plot and stored the figure showing the real soil mean and a histogram of the randomly generated soil means,
# generate the p-values (using significantly different),
# and store the real population soil eans and p-values in their respective lists

#creating the list of soil metrics to iterate over
